#### Code Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the functions, variables, and key information in the code. Let's go through each section:

#### Functions

1. `scmd(cmd)`: This function executes a shell command using the `subprocess.run()` method. It takes a command as a parameter and runs it in the shell.

2. `initialize()`: This function sets up the initial variables and configurations for the script. It imports necessary modules, sets default values for variables, and initializes the console.

3. `sharks()`: This function checks if there are any command-line arguments provided. If arguments are present, it joins them into a single string and executes the command using the `scmd()` function. If no arguments are provided, it calls the `cmdline()` function.

4. `make_the_sharks_swim()`: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It calls the `initialize()` and `sharks()` functions to start the execution.

5. `incstack(number)`: This function sets the recursion limit for the Python interpreter using the `sys.setrecursionlimit()` method. It takes a number as a parameter and sets the recursion limit accordingly.

6. `readfile(filename)`: This function reads the contents of a file and returns them as a string. It takes the filename as a parameter.

7. `writefile(fnw, data)`: This function writes the given data to a file. It takes the filename and data as parameters.

8. `nreadfile()`: This function prompts the user to enter a filename and then reads and prints the contents of that file.

9. `nwritefile()`: This function prompts the user to enter a filename and then allows them to enter the content to be written to that file.

10. `notepad()`: This function prompts the user to choose between reading or writing a file and calls the corresponding function (`nreadfile()` or `nwritefile()`).

11. `tkin()`: This function opens a tkinter window with a text input field and a submit button. When the button is clicked, the input text is stored in the `tkinp` variable and written to a file using the `writefile()` function.

12. `readtkin()`: This function reads and prints the contents of the file created by the `tkin()` function.

13. Various utility functions (`cd()`, `mkdir()`, `pyrun()`, `inrun()`, `pwd()`, `clear()`, `delete()`, `rmdir()`, `ls()`, `curl()`, `refresh()`, `sideload()`, `vim()`, `nknkdef()`, `cmdline()`) perform different operations related to file manipulation, system commands, and command-line interface interactions.

#### Important variables
- `DefaultDir`: This variable stores the default directory path.

- `Source`: This variable stores the source file path.

- `SystemShell`: This variable stores the path to the system shell executable.
