# NKNK
NKNK is a project to make a shell in *mostly* python, also depending on other projects made in *mostly* python like xonsh.
NKNK is a recursive acronym for NK's not KSL.
Ksl (Knife Sharp Library) was a library for K#(Knife sharp) although the reference to C# KS was NOT a programming language, simply a intepreter for a KS files.
KS files were a special text format to shorten infomation. KSL was never finished, but shortly before it ended, it had a final commit for, a selector menu, developer testing selection program, and a CLI.
NKNK is a improved version of the KSL.CMDLINE that is easily hackable. Every part of NKNK is hackable, due to it all being written in python, with a few exeptions.

NKNK is still unable to run as the main shell, this will later be fixed because of the cmdline being replaced with a rust executable communicating to either nknk.py, or xonsh.tur

NKNK *might* change directions, become an OS using either redox or cleese's microkernel.
