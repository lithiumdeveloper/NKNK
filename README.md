# NKNK
NKNK is a project to make a shell in *mostly* python, also depending on other projects made in *mostly* python like xonsh.
NKNK is a recursive acronym for NK's not KSL.
Ksl (Knife Sharp Library) was a library for K#(Knife sharp).
KSL was never finished, but shortly before it ended, it had a final commit for, a selector menu, developer testing selection program, and a CLI.
NKNK is a improved version of the KSL.CMDLINE that is easily hackable. Every part of NKNK is hackable, due to it all being written in python, with a few exeptions.

All files are in master
